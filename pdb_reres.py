# For the `pdbprep` project, pdb-tools scripts were modified to reduce their
# versatility in exchange for additonal speed. The core algorithm of the script
# was maintained, but boilerplate to create a versatile command-line was
# removed, and some arguments were blocked to specific options.  Modifications
# to the original `pdb-tools` scripts were done by João M.C. Teixeira
# (@joaomcteixeira) who is co-author in the `pdb-tools` project. Any credit to
# the value of `pdb-tools` scripts present in the `pdbprep` project should be
# given to the original `pdb-tools` project.
